        <time datetime="1935">1935</time> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving

        Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1941">1941</time> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
        asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1942">1942</time> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1944">1944</time> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to
        head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent
        wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1945">1945</time> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1953">1953</time> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
        that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1962">1962</time> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
        mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="1970">1970</time> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
      </li>

      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="2005">2005</time> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
        are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
        because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people
        were selecting the best breeds."
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="2009">2009</time> - dies at the age of 95.
